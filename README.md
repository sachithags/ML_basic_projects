# **Wine Quality Dataset**

**Overview**

This dataset contains information about various physicochemical properties of white and red wine samples, along with their quality ratings. The data can be used to analyze the relationship between wine characteristics and perceived quality, or to build predictive models for wine quality assessment.

**Dataset Details**

File Name: winequality.csv
Format: CSV (Comma-Separated Values)
Number of Rows: 1,599 (including header)
Number of Columns: 13

**Variables**

- type: Type of wine (white or red)
- fixed acidity: Primary fixed acids in wine (tartaric, malic, citric, etc.)
- volatile acidity: Amount of acetic acid in wine (high levels can lead to unpleasant vinegar taste)
- citric acid: Found in small quantities, adds freshness and flavor
- residual sugar: Amount of sugar remaining after fermentation stops
- chlorides: Amount of salt in the wine
- free sulfur dioxide: Free form of SO₂, prevents microbial growth and oxidation
- total sulfur dioxide: Amount of free and bound forms of SO₂
- density: The density of water is close to that of water, depending on alcohol and sugar content
- pH: Describes how acidic or basic a wine is (0-14 scale)
- sulphates: Additive that can contribute to SO₂ gas levels
- alcohol: Percent alcohol content of the wine
- quality: Score between 0 (very bad) and 10 (very excellent), based on sensory data

**Notes**
- Some values are missing (represented by empty cells).
- Quality scores range from 3 to 9 in this dataset.
- The data appears to be a combination of white and red wine samples.
